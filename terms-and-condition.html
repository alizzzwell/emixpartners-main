                        commission collectively exceeds the minimum threshold. We will account to you for the commission
                        on a per-calendar month basis and pay you the commission due in respect of any calendar month no
                        later than thirty-one (31) days after the end of the calendar month in which the Commission
                        arose. For example, the Commission due to you in relation to the calendar month of September

                      <li> Where Commission earned by a Partner in relation to a HRC results in a negative amount in any
                        calendar month, the Company reserves the right at its sole discretion to carry forward, in full,
                        any such negative amounts and set off the amounts which have been carried forward against any
                        future Commission payable to the Partner in relation to the same HRC until the negative balance
                        has been fully set off against future Commission. </li>
